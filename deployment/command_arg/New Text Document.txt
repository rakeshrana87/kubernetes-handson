command that run when container starts
docker run ovveride cmd .  
sleep 5
sleep10 - run dont want 10 
sleep command should come automatically 
cmd command line parameters get replcaed wheres in entry point it is appended.
cmd as shell form or json form first should be executable 
docker ruin --<arg> 

will append in arg form in yaml
arg will replace docker cmd 
and for entry point we need to in docker run --entrypoint

Entrypoiny[sleep] ---> command[sleep2.0]
same thing in yaml
